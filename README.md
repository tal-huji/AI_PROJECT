# Stock Trading with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements reinforcement learning (RL) models to perform stock trading. The goal is to train RL agents that can learn from historical stock data and make informed trading decisions. The project leverages various techniques, including online normalization and dynamic feature extraction, to ensure the agent operates effectively in dynamic market conditions.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply execute the `main.py` script. All parameters and settings for the model, training, and environment are configured within the `config.py` file. There's no need to provide additional command-line arguments, as everything is already set in the configuration file.

Run the project with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
